/**
 *  This plugin is for Kawa 5 and will not work on previous versions though it
 *  will be fairly easy to port. I decided to write this plugin since I used to
 *  write my code in Kawa and then reopen it with the slow java editor jEdit
 *  just to add code comments. So one night I spend some minutes in creating
 *  this simple plugin and now I have pretty print feature in my Kawa - thanks
 *  to folks who created jrefactory (http://jrefactory.sf.net/).<P>
 *
 *  Instructions for installation:<BR>
 *
 *  <UL>
 *    <LI> Extract KawaPrettyPrint.jar in <EM>KAWA</EM> \plugin directory.
 *    <LI> From "Customize" menu select "Commands" and then "Plugin Command"
 *
 *    <LI> Press button "New" and write down "KawaPrettyPrint" for "Menu Name"
 *
 *    <LI> Set "Main Class" to "org.acm.seguin.ide.kawa.KawaPrettyPrint"
 *    <LI> If you wish KawaPrettyPrint to automaticaly beautify your source on
 *    file save set "Arguments" to "-install" (without quotes)
 *    <LI> Set classpath to the folder where KawaPrettyPrint is installed and to
 *    the file jrefactory.jar located in the same directory.
 *    <LI> If you set "Arguments" to -install you may open Options tab and
 *    select "Execute command when Kawa starts". If you didn't set -install
 *    option then you may wish to select "Add command to right button menu in
 *    editor"
 *    <LI> Enjoy!
 *  </UL>
