===========================

JRefactory Version 2.9.18
-------------------------
    o Fixed JRefactory bugs:
          + 944638 "javadoc with embedded // comments".

    o Fix selections from cut and paste detector from Netbeans.


JRefactory Version 2.9.17
-------------------------
    o Ensure that rename field is only offered for fields (not method local variable).
    o Fixed bug that caused stubs to be created with no entries for some classes (mainly generic classes and interfaces).
    o Fixed bug that caused stubs to be created with no entries for methods of interfaces.
    o Swing load status is now always visible while loading is taking place
    o Allow other threads some processing time while perform the soruce file parsing.
    o Automatically switch between 1.4.2 and 1.5.0 when generating file summaries.

JRefactory Version 2.9.16
-------------------------
    o Automatically switch between 1.4.2 and 1.5.0 when generating stubs from JDK src.zip
    o Improved Netbeans support, major integration complete, still lots of minor things to do.


JRefactory Version 2.9.15
-------------------------
    o Fixed JRefactory bugs:
          + 929006 "param.descr does not work for constructors".
            now not having a "param.descr" or having "param.descr=" in the settings file will cause @param tags to be NOT generated.
          + 897760 "Basically nonfunctional - UML diagram attempt".
          + 877400 "pretty.settings end.line property comments need a fix".
            Added the following:
            # End of line character(s) - either CR, CRNL, or NL
            # * CR - carriage return
            # * NL - newline
            # * LF - newline/linefeed
            # * CRNL - carriage return and newline
            # * MAC - mac carriage return
            # * UNIX - unix newline
            # * DOS - carriage return and newline
            # * ASIS - leave line endings alone - NOT IMPLEMENTED
            end.line=CRNL
    o Fixed sorting so it works for enums and Annotation type definitions.
    o Fixed parsing and pretty printing of Annotation type definitions.
    o Added fix to allow multiple semicolons at the end of import statements
    o Fixed Line Count Visitor for annotations.
    o Fixed Summary Load Visitor for annotations (it won't throw an exception, but probably not good enough for refactoring with annotations).
    o Fixed (I hope) the build_jedit.xml build.
    o Fixed regression with pretty printing from JBuilder, introduced a couple of versions ago.
    o Improved Netbeans support


JRefactory Version 2.9.14
-------------------------
    o Added many fixes to the standalone JRefactory demo.


JRefactory Version 2.9.13 - ant task release only
-------------------------
    o Fixed JRefactory bugs:
          + 861011 "Pretty Ant task - CVSUtil daylight savings time problem".
            Added a timeZone attribute to the ant task. Clarified ant task comments
          + 860617 "Pretty Ant task write cr at end of all lines".


JRefactory Version 2.9.12
-------------------------
    o Fixed dragging of Types in UML Viewer.
    o Added JUnit tests for RenameMethod refactoring
    o Updated JUnit tests for RenameField to show the problem with bug
    o 813879 "rename field does not detect downcast"
    o Minor update to Navigator to put class name first in tree entry.
    o Fixed "show" and "hide" buttons on JRefactory tab.
    o Added ExtractMethod action to Refactoring menus - does not work yet.
    o For those refactorings that fail JUnit tests show warning dialog before activation.
    o Made calls to JRefactory and Coding Standards functions select JavaStyle plugin and switch to appropriate tab.
    o Fixed enabling of the code Navigator.
    o Added more icons mainly for interfaces.
    o Fixed package selector panel tree for classes without a package statement.
    o Added a popup menu to the package selector window with Remove module as its only item.
      Remove module does not currently remove the package summaries that made it up.
    o If JAI is present enable saving of UML diagrams in PNG.
    o jEdit only: keep track of which project is loaded.
    o Fixed popup "No problems found" coming up twice.
    o Rewrote UML diagrams to made them look better and the code be easier to use and modify.
    o Refactored actions.
    o Made action usage more consistent across usages.

          + ShowSourceAction
          + LoadPackageAction
          + SaveImageAction
    o jEdit only: added messages JavaStylePlugin$JavaAST and JavaStylePlugin$JavaTree.
      These are EditBus messages offering the parsed Java Abstract Syntax Tree and the tree used by the Navigator respectively.
      There may be a 5 second delay between typing a character and the tree being updated
    o Fixed JRefactory bugs:
          + 845897 "Cannot access classes from tree"


JRefactory Version 2.9.11
-------------------------
    o Added ability to parse JSP files, it works for simple JSP files.
      The idea is to pretty print only the Java portions of the JSP files, This does not work yet.
    o Added ability to call refactoring methods directly from the Coding Standards deficiency report.
      This only works for method names that are too short at present. Soon other refactorings will be available
    o Added a new refactoring Rename Method. This has not yet been fully tested.
    o jEdit only: added greying out of menu items that are not available.
    o jEdit only: added ability to refactor from the jEdit main view (i.e. as well as from the UML viewer).
    o Removed EditorOperations and merged those functions with the IDEInterface.


JRefactory Version 2.9.10
-------------------------
    o This release was the first for some time of a Netbeans IDE plugin.

JRefactory Version 2.9.4
-------------------------
    o Added parsing and pretty printing of annotations as defined in the JSR 175 public review.
      Still a few minor problems with pretty printing annotations, but in general it seems to work well.
    o Fixed JRefactory bugs:
          + 831399 "Source code with Chinese characters."
          + 815070 "Non-ascii characters get replaced by '?'."

          + 575876 "comment start formatting."
          + 464480 "shorter comments."
          + 446058 "Sort exception names in "throws"."
          + 446056 "Sort interface names in "implements"."
          + 812738 "Space between operators in expressions."
            This seems to have been fixed for some time, but I've only now closed the RFE.

            It is probably the same bug as 815070 "Non-ascii characters get replaced by '?'", but I can't tell.
    o Fixed jEdit IDE JavaStyle Plugin bugs:
          + 812738 "JavaStyle left aligns broken lines with comments."

* (options) Improved the option dialogs, now includes some PMD options in a separate JTagPane
* (Coding Standards) imported the regression tests from PMD and ran them. A few still fail :-(
* (Parser) Fixed bugs in how SimpleNode works.
* (Parser) Fixed two bugs in equals() methods which caused AST nodes that where not equal to be evaluated as the same.
* (Parser) All AST nodes that are created programatically now have their type IDs set.
* (Parser) now handles cntrl-z at the end of files
